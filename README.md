## Dataset
CIFAR-10 (60,000 images, 10 classes)

## Framework
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Google Colab (GPU)

## Levels Completed
- Level 1: Baseline ResNet-18 (Test Accuracy: 92.16%)
- Level 2: Data Augmentation & Regularization (93.35%)
- Level 3:Model Explainability & Analysis
  `Used Grad-CAM to visualize class-discriminative regions`
  `Heatmaps highlight object-focused regions influencing predictions`
  `Confusion matrix shows strong diagonal dominance`
  `Minor confusion observed between visually similar classes (e.g., cat and dog)`
